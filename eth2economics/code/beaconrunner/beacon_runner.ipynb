    "# _Beacon Runner_: A `BeaconState` cadCAD wrap\n",
    "\n",
    "###### January 2020, [@barnabemonnot](https://twitter.com/barnabemonnot)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this document is to get the specs running in a [cadCAD](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD) simulation environment, using the `BeaconState` object defined in the [eth2 specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md). cadCAD is a cool new framework to simulate complex dynamics, in particular in stochastic environments. This makes it ideal to simulate the models of token economics and more generally any system that is controlled by state updates and user interactions. You can learn more about cadCAD by following [Markus Koch](https://twitter.com/markusbkoch)'s [tutorials](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/demos), especially [part 5](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/demos/blob/master/tutorials/robots_and_marbles/robot-marbles-part-5/robot-marbles-part-5.ipynb) on using class objects as a state variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we present the dynamics of block proposers on the beacon chain first, to get a feel of how the chain evolves over time. Then, we introduce validation proper, where validators cast votes to finalise the chain. If we think in game-theoretic terms, here we really just want to understand the basic space of decision-making of the several players in the protocol, as well as the information available to them when such decisions are made. We simplify the presentation by assuming there is no latency and all validators can always access the latest state. A more detailed model will relax these assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll introduce basic building blocks of eth2 as we go along, but there is a ton of resources out there to learn more ([Ben Edgington's portal](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/By6gV_dXS) is an excellent place to start for instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start! We first need to load a bunch of stuff. Make sure you have cadCAD installed, pandas and all the fluff that comes with your favourite Python distribution. Alternatively, find a cool guide [here](https://community.cadcad.org/t/python-newbies-setup-for-cadcad/101) to do all that painlessly."

    "We move on to defining the dynamics. Simple dynamical systems follow some rules to update their state, e.g., the orbits of planets are given by laws derived from attraction. More complex systems are _controlled_: decisions made by agents in the system influence the state evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our setting, these agents are validators. State evolution is governed by the rules of the virtual machine, while validators get to decide on blocks and transactions. The resulting state is a combination of agent decisions and state updates. How validators make these decisions is embodied by _policy functions_: given a state, make a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In eth2, time is subdivided in _epochs_, themselves divided in _slots_. At most one block should be proposed at each slot, while accounting for votes and doling out rewards and penalties is done at the end of each epoch. Note that to speed things up in this document, we set the `SLOTS_PER_EPOCH` constant to 4 in the `constants.py` file. This is 8x faster than the value in the current specs. (ICO when???)\n",
    "\n",
    "We now define policies and state updates to run the simulation. Let's take a moment to understand how state transitions work in the [eth2 specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md), with notation we introduce here to clarify the different states.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given a slot $s$, define $\\omega^-[s]$ as the _pre-state_ of $s$. Once a block $b_s$ is proposed for slot $s$, the specs-defined `process_block` obtains state $\\omega^+[s]$ from $\\omega^-[s]$ and $b_s$.\n",
    "2. To go from $\\omega^+[s]$ to $\\omega^-[s+1]$, the specs-defined `process_slots` caches the block root of $b_s$ and the state root. If $s+1$ is the first slot of a new epoch, `process_epoch` is called which checks for justification and finalisation of checkpoints as well as attribute rewards and punishments to active validators and process exits and new entries.\n",
    "3. From $\\omega^-[s+1]$, we repeat the first two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about the start of this process. The `genesis_state` object defined above really is $\\omega^-[0]$. When we call `process_genesis_block`, we move to $\\omega^+[0]$. This is the **initial condition** of our simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our simulation, we move the state ahead given a block $b_s$ for slot $s$ from $\\omega^+[s-1]$ to $\\omega^+[s]$. We will break it down in three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **(State update)** Process slot `s-1`, moving from $\\omega^+[s-1]$ to $\\omega^-[s]$. If a block was proposed during slot $s-1$, the root of the block is cached in the `block_roots` attribute of $\\omega^-[s]$, at index `s-1`. Otherwise, the root of the most recent block is cached. Additionally, if `s-1` is the last slot of an epoch, `process_epoch` is called.\n",
    "2. **(Policy)** A policy for block proposers to propose a new block $b_s$ at slot $s$.\n",
    "3. **(State update)** Process block $b_s$, taking $\\omega^-[s]$ to $\\omega^+[s]$.\n",

    "### 1. Process slot\n",
    "\n",
    "The arguments of this function are given to us by the cadCAD execution environment. `s` holds the current state of the simulation, where `s['beacon_state']` returns the current beacon state.

    "Now how can we extend this model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can define very specific validation behaviour and test what happens under different scenarios. Here we have focused on the \"honest\" behaviour, which is hopefully what validators on eth2 will follow. But hope is not enough, so much like [mining in Proof-of-Work, it remains to prove that good behaviour in the protocol exactly corresponds to rational behaviour in the _game_ defined by the protocol](https://hackingresear.ch/diaries/anarchy-creta).\n",
    "- We can also tweak state updates to represent network delays and modify the information basis of validators, who we assumed here always have the latest data to make their attestations. This may be a good use case for cadCAD's support for stochastic simulations (where execution may depend on chance events).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some efforts should also be spent making the simulation lighter to execute, so that larger models can be tested, including stochastic events using Monte-Carlo methods which require repeating executions a significant amount of times."
