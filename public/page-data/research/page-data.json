A system called Halo first demonstrated a new methodology for building PCD without SNARKs, exploiting an aggregation property of the Bulletproofs innerproduct argument. The construction was heuristic because it makes non-black-box use of a concrete instantiation of the Fiat-Shamir transform. We expand upon this methodology to show that PCD can be (heuristically) built from any homomorphic polynomial commitment scheme (PCS), even if the PCS evaluation proofs are neither succinct nor efficient. In fact, the\\nHalo methodology extends to any PCS that has an even more general property, namely the ability to aggregate linear combinations of commitments into a new succinct commitment that can later be opened to this linear combination.
